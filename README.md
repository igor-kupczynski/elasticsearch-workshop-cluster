Elasticsearch Workshop
======================

What is it?
-----------

This is an ansible playbook to create an elasticsearch cluster on few
vanilla Ubuntu 14.04 machines (e.g. the ones you can provision at
digital ocean). The cluster can be useful for experimentation or, with
some tweaking, to your particular use case in production.

Background
----------
If you followed my blog you may known than I'm responsible for
changing my employer's in-house search appliance to a new one backed
by Elasticsearch. We had a huge data volume, even though we are not
fully migrated to Elasticsearch yet. During our day to day operations
we see a lot of interesting cases. I think we reached that point where
reading documentation, news groups and blogs is simply not enough to
explain everything we see in the trenches. I often feel a need to
experiment with an Elasticsearch cluster.

I've created an ansible playbook to provision one. With the playbook,
ut is a dead-easy task to provision the cluster in matter of
minutes. I use vanilla Ubuntu 14.04 machines on [digital ocean][do],
but any other cloud provide will work.

Additionally, on *26.03.2015* I'll conduct a workshop on Elasticsearch
at [Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology][put], i.e. my *alma matter*. In
order to make it simple for students I've created a cluster which we
can use on the workshop.

Cluster architecture
--------------------

* HAProxy in front of an Elasticsearch cluster.
* 1 machine for haproxy (this can be the same box as one of the other
  nodes)
* 1+ machine for elasticsearch nodes; all nodes play all the roles -
  master, client and data
* haproxy accesses the nodes via http protocol on :9200
* the nodes form a cluster and communicate via the native protocol on
  :9300
* all the ports are blocked both from the public internet and the
  private network with the exceptions of:
    * 9300 and 9200 on the private network, they are used to for m a
      cluster and to accept the requests from haproxy
    * 80, 11936 are open for the public access on haproxy node
    * 22 is open everywhere

Prerequisites
-------------

1+ vanilla Ubuntu 14.04 server (it'll probably work with other
Ubuntus, but I've tested it on 14.04).

You need to know IP addresses of the machines in the cluster and have
a root access there (or a sudo user access).

I provisioned it in digital ocean, in the Amsterdam 3 region, with
*private networking* enabled. I've had 3 Ubuntu 14.04 droplets with
1GB ram each. The first node hosted both an ES node and a haproxy.

The playbook is smart enough to calculate number of nodes required to
elect a master avoid [split-brain][split-brain] problem. It also sets
the memory which Elasticsearch will use to be half of the system total
RAM. This is consistent with the [recommendations][es-memory].

Deploying the cluster
---------------------

1. Clone the repo
2. Create some Ubuntu 14.04 hosts to put the cluster on
3. Fill in the host details:

        $ cp inventory.in inventory
        $ vim inventory

4. Set the passwords

        $ cp secrets.yml.in secrets.yml
        $ vim secrets.yml

5. Play!

        $ ansible-playbook -i inventory es-workshop.yml

   If you use a use a sudo user you should do this instead

        $ ansible-playbook -i inventory -u <your-user> -s es-workshop.yml

    In digital ocean machines eth0 is the public ip and eth1 is the
    private (within datacenter) interface. In the playbook I use
    private networking to form a cluster, but your configuration may
    be different. You may want to let the nodes talk over the public
    internet (if you do experiments, this is not good for production)
    or simply eth0 maybe your private adapter. Then add ` --extra-vars
    "private_network_interface: ansible_eth0"` to the commands you
    run, e.g.

        $ ansible-playbook -i inventory --extra-vars "private_network_interface: ansible_eth0" es-workshop.yml

You cluster is accessible via the proxy machine

    $ curl -u "user:pass" http://proxy-machine
    {
        "status" : 200,
        "name" : "es-workshop-1",
        "cluster_name" : "es-workshop",
        "version" : {
            "number" : "1.4.4",
            "build_hash" : "c88f77ffc81301dfa9dfd81ca2232f09588bd512",
            "build_timestamp" : "2015-02-19T13:05:36Z",
            "build_snapshot" : false,
            "lucene_version" : "4.10.3"
        },
        "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
    }


You can also access haproxy stats, just go to http://188.166.17.197:11936/

# Not production ready!

This cluster is for workshops/experiments. In real world you need to at least:

* set up https connection to avoid sending passwords in plaintext
* separate data nodes from clients from masters
* fine-tune Elasticsearch config to your particular use case
* [rolling restart][rolling-restart] to perform the upgrades or
  configuration changes while keeping the cluster on-line
* backups

Why ansible?
------------

There are many tools to help you automate your deployment,
provisioning and configuration nowadays. [Ansible][ansible] stands out
as easy to use --- it uses yaml as DSL, popular --- lot of blog posts
and recipes on-line and most of all --- agent-less. It is purely SSH
based and doesn't need any kind of a central server to coordinate. It
makes Ansible perfect for small projects with small teams.

It was recommended too my by one of my devops colleagues at
[Egnyte][egn]. We use puppet to manage the infrastructure there, but
it seems an overkill for a small pet-project.
